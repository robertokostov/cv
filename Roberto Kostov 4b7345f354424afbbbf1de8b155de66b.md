# Roberto Kostov

<aside>
👋 I'm a **DevOps/Cloud Engineer** currently based in **Skopje, North Macedonia** with **over 5 years of experience** in the software industry. 
My focus area for the past few years has been managing AWS infrastructure using Terraform and CDK (TypeScript), as well as improving developer experience by managing CI/CD blueprints in GitLab, but I'm also skilled in other areas. Fond of automating stuff in any way possible. You can always learn from or give something to the people around you, no matter the title. Just need to show that you
care.

# 🛠️ Skills

### Infrastructure as Code

My "native" IaC as code language is Terraform, which I have used in the best part of my experience in DevOps so far. Created modules from scratch or implemented already existing ones, either open sourced ones from AWS, or internal ones. Experienced with CDK in a more limited fashion. Also testing experience with OpenTofu

### Cloud

My “native” cloud provider is AWS, where the majority of my experience so far is in. Also have used Google Cloud and OVH Cloud in a few projects, as well as management of an on-premise infrastructure (Kubernetes clusters)

### CI/CD

Used pretty much all of the stuff that are out there. Feeling most comfortable with GitLab, considering that is the one I use mostly in the last beyond a year. Other than that, used GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Octopus Deploy, Jenkins, Helm in various projects

### Application management

Used Docker in most of my projects so far. Some of the times the orchestration has been done with stuff like ECS (or GCR in Google Cloud), while other times it has been done with Kubernetes

### Mentoring and leading

New fields that I am getting better at. Have lead a group of six people that were associates for the first year. Also served as a mentor in a different company to people with technical gaps to help bridge them. Fond of that feeling to *be the senior you needed when you were younger* for the people around you
